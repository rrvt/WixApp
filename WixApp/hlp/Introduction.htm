<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This project started as a way to remember how to construct a decent installer using Wix.  The syntax of Wix is just
  bizarre enough that every 6 months or so when I need to create one I had to learn it all over again.  So WixApp was constructed to
  provide a simple method for construction a Wix input file.  That is then compiled using Visual Studio in the normal way
  and an installer is created.
</p>
<p>
    Wix is a very complex product, WixApp is very simple.  There are only a few things that it can do:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accept files that need to be installed in Progarm Files (x86)</li>
    <li>Create Shortcuts (when requested) on the start menu and the desktop</li>
    <li>Create one or more directories as needed into which files are placed in Program Files</li>
    <li>It can create up to two levels of directories in Program Files and the Start Menu</li>
    <li>If requested it will append a path to the system path</li>
    <li>When WixApp is installed, SetEnv will also be installed</li>
    <li>The version number may be retrieved from an executable for the installer to use during installation</li>
    <li>It will create an uninstaller that will remove all of the files and directories that it creates</li>
</ul>


<h2>How Does WixApp Work</h2>
<p>
	WixApp on starup presents an empty dialog box with a few menu items (one of which is Help that displays this text).
  The Files Menu allows one to create a new WixApp data file (i.e. "xxx.wxd") and Wix input file Product.wxs.  It also allows one 
  to open an existing data file.  The dialog box is populated from a data file or is left blank for the user to supply new data.  When one
  is satisfied with the input the Create button saves both the data file and a new Product.wxs file.
  Up to 10 previous Product.wxs files are kept as backup (e.g. Product.wxs.23).
  The the Wix compilation can take place, errors noted and changes made to the WixApp dialog box.
</p>

<h2>Wix File Structure</h2>
<p>
	Wix has roughly four main sections:
  <ul>
		<li>Product Section</li>
		<li>Features Section</li>
		<li>Directory Section</li>
		<li>Components Section</li>
  </ul>
  The Product Section contains information about the product, the icons, some data about the installer, 
  and the list of "Features."  A Feature is just a list of components and the Product section can 
  contain one or more "Features." The Directory Section contains a description of all the directories 
  used by the installer.  Please note that some of the Directory IDs are magic words so take care 
  changing them outside of WixApp.  A Component is a description of exactly one file and what is 
  to be done with the file during installation.  Wix is not particularly sensitive about the order 
  of these sections so WixApp creates the Product file in a way that works.
</p>
<p>
	WixApp takes a different approach.  There is one main dialog box (and a 
  couple of minor ones).  It has four edit boxes and one button to enter
  the necessary data for the Product Section.  It has a drop down combo box 
  and two buttons for managing a Feature (a Feature is a list of Components).
  There is a drop down combo box and two buttons that allow the user to 
  manage components.  The 
  attributes for a component may be entered/modifed in five edit boxes, four  check boxes and a couple of browse buttons.
</p>
<p>
	The user supplies the information about all the Features and Components 
  for each feature and WixApp rearranges the information for Wix.
</p>
<h2>Directory Paths</h2>
<p>
	A path in Windows is the text description of the location of a directory in a tree of directories.  
  It is typically composed of a hard drive letter followed by colon and back slash followed by one or 
  more names separated from each other by back slashes.  WixApp may construct the Product.wxs using a 
  fully qualified path or to use the location of the 
  Visual Studio solution file as the starting point for a path (i.e. $SolutionDir)..\Release\xxx.exe).</p>
<p>  
  When New is selected in the File Menu a dialog box describes 
  this step and next takes one to an open file dialog box to select the xxx.sln file for the project.
  If something happens (like a reorganization of the directories) the solution path may be adjusted by
  the selecting the Solution Menu item.  The solution need only be input once usually so it does not appear 
  in the Main Dialog Box.
	The Solution Dialog Box allows the user to use either addresses relative to the Solution directory or absolute
  addresses.
