<h2>Toolbar Operations</h2>
<p>
The typical sequence of commands is from left to right on the toolbar.
</p>
<h3>New Project</h3>
<p>
A Project must exist somewhere.  So the first step is identify two directories for the project.  This is
done with a dialog box that pops up when the New Project command is invoked.
The root directory is used as a starting point for selecting the first object of a type in the project.
The Solution Path is the path to the project.sln.  This allows all other paths to be relative to the
path to project.sln .
</p>
<h3>Open Project</h3>
<p>
The Open Project command brings up a open file dialog box set up to look for an "wxd" file and the initial
path is to the last place it found or stored a "wxd" file.  Selecting the wxd file will cause the WixApp
file to be loaded.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes paths will be requested using a "specify file/path dialog box".  Be sure to look at the title 
bar of the dialog box and/or the type of file being sought.
</p>
<h3>Save All Files</h3>
<p>
There are two files created by WixApp.  The product.wxs file is used by Visual Studio Wix option to create
the project.msi file.  The second file created by WixApp is the WixApp data file, project.wxd.  WixApp
saves the old files by renaming with a 12 character numerical extension to the current files.  The 
numerical extension is the current date and time to the nearest second organized so they sort for oldest to
newest.
</p>
<h3>Save Wxd file</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the data for the installation file is not ready to create a product file.  Save just the
WixApp data file (i.e. "wxd" file).
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/Options.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Options</h3>
<p>
Brings up a dialog box that has two features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A check box to allow the same version number to be used during installation</li>
<li>A check box and a view  window to require a license dialog to be added during installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Allowing use of the same version number seems to allow the current version to remain.  I would use
this option with care.  
</p>
<p>
Checking the license dialog will cause a file dialog to appear.  The file dialog will request
that an "rtf" file be selected.  
MakeApp adds the file LicenseFile.rtf to the <app>.wix project directory or one can create a license 
file in Word and in any event it should describe the license that is being required for installing 
the product.  
During installation a dialog box displays this text and is used to require checking a check box to claim
that the license is being observed.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/About.jpg" width="16" height="15"> About</h3>
<p>
Displays the About Box.  The about box uses text from the resource file (WixApp.rc) for
the output information.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/Exit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Exit</h3>
<p>
Exit the application with no reservations.
