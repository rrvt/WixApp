A new version of Product.wxs is created by this program.  Two additional files (My_en-us.wxl and My_InstallDir.wxs) are copied into the directory where Product.wxs resides.  Both of these files are required during the compilation of the Installer.\r\n\r\n
The first time Product.wxs is produced the user must add My_en-us.wxl and My_InstallDir.wxs to the installer project in Visual Studio.  The steps to add the two files are as follows:\r\n\r\n
* In Visual Studio highlight the Installer Project\r\n
* Right Click the Installer Project name\r\n
* In the drop down menu the pops up after the right click select Add/Existing Item\r\n
* Add My_en-us.wxl\r\n
* Add My_InstallDir.wxs\r\n
The “Installer.msi” file is stored in a sub-directory of the current output directory ($(OutDir).  The sub-directory is named “en-US”.  If you would rather it be placed in the current output directory with all the other files find the “Post-build Event Command Line” box.  The box is located by right clicking on the Installer Project name, selecting properties (i.e. at the bottom of the pop-up menu) and selecting the “Build Events” tab on the left hand side of the properties window.  Then copy the following line into the box:\r\n\r\n
   copy $(OutDir)en-US\<installer name>.msi $(OutDir)
