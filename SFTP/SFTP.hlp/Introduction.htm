<h2>Secure FTP Implementation</h2>
<p>
Web Host implementations have moved on and left legacy applications like Dreamweaver behind.  The particular host
that I use moved to Secure FTP with which to upload files.  Clearly a new mechnaism is needed to upload files.  This 
application purports to upload only those files that need to be uploaded.  Unfortunately, sometimes we need 
to delete files on the web host and sometimes we need to download files from the web host.
furthermore, directories may be needed to created or deleted on the web host and sometimes directories
need to created in the local PC version of the web site.
</p>
<p>
  There are two comparisons that may be performed in this application:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compare the present and absence of directories and files  in the web host and the local PC.</li>
  <li>Compare the size and date of each file at the last transfer between the local PC and web host and
the current size and date of each file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The present/absence comparison is useful when starting out.  It produces a list of directories and files 
to create/upload (transfer files from the local PC to the web host) and/or create/download (transfer files
from the web host to the local PC).  It just attempts to make the two copies the same.  It is useful to 
get an initial cownload of a website either to compare with an old copy or to start making changes to an
existing web site for which no local PC copy exists.  During this transfer a record is made of the size 
and date of each local PC file for use later.  Note, that while the directories on the web host may be
created or deleted to mimic the directories on the PC version of the site, new directories on the PC may
only be created on the PC to mimic the directories that appear on the web host.
</p>

<p>
The size/date comparison is useful when updating local PC files wherein the local PC files and web host
files started out identical (even though the date and sizes may not be identical the content is).  Thus
make a spelling change in one or more of the local PC files and use SFTP size/date comparison to upload
only those files that have changed since the last update.  Directories are either present or absent and
that information is used to create or delete directories on the web host.  Furthermore, files that are
added in directories that are not on the web host are added after the directories are created.
</p>

<p>
The size/date comparison results in two operations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upload a file that has changed on the local PC</li>
  <li>Delete a file on the host that has been removed from the list of files on the local PC</li>
</ul>  

<p>
Now having described the comparisons please note that the comparisons only mark a list of the web site
files for being updated.  The Update command is used implement the operations.  However there is a little
gotcha that the update command tries to avoid by using a check box for each operation so that the
user must check a box for each operation to be performed.  Of course there is a do-all button too.  Please
note that adding a file in a non-existent directory will also cause the directory(ies) to be created even
if the missing directory check box is not selected... 
</p>

<p>
What is the gotcha?  The present/absence comparison only marks uploads and downloads.  The size/date
comparison only marks uploads and deletions.  The same missing file in the current list will produce
different operations (download and deletion) for the same file.  So the operations marked by one
comparison are not overruled by the second comparison if one chooses to use both comparions.  That seemed
to be the more sensible rule but I could be wrong about that.
</p>

<p>
This gotcha is due to the point of view.  The present/absence
comparison is trying to make the local PC files match the web host files and vica versa.  The size/date comparison of the local 
files  is trying to make the web host match what the author has prepared in the local PC file list.  Both comparisons have their uses.
</p>


<p>
However, there is a little issue at the beginning.  If the web site already exists and SFTP is
being used for the first time to update the web site then there is no past history database for
the web site.  So if the web host files are downloaded into an empty directory on the local PC they can
be compared on the local PC with a difference program to determine which of the files are different.
Then correct the files that are out of date and upload only those files to get a record of the current
size and date.  After the initial upload SFTP will only indicate changed files for uploading and/or deleting.
</p>

<p>
Of course if there is no local PC copy of the database then the download itself will create the size and
date records.
</p>

<p>
In any event this application works more like Dreamweaver in that it alerts the user to files that
need updating on the web site and facilitating the update.
